## Description
A tree-structure is a common structure in the computer science field. As such, it is a common design challenge to solve, i.e., how to represent such structure programatically. Composite design pattern answers this question. It is based on the idea of a `Component` which is an `abstract class` with `abstract` common method which needs to be implemented by all subclasses. In my [SimpleExample](SimpleExample.java), this common method is `getSize()`. Then there can be two kinds of sub-classes: `Leaf` (e.g. File) and `Composite` (e.g. Directory). As the name suggests, `Composite` may consist of other `Entries` that maybe either of type `Leaf` or also `Composite`.
